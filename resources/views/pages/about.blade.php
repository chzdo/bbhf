      2 Corinthians 8: 7( Our Inspiration)

      Blessed to Bless Hands Foundation ( BBHF) was inspired by the Macedonian Church example. They were known to be a Church that was not necessarily rich materially but excelled in giving to meet the needs of others, that by their contributions they massively meet the needs of others. 
     We believe at BBHF, that the Macedonian Church example is a practical and workable approach and initiative for meeting the needs of not just the church but the 21st century and coming centuries societies.
     Therefore, we made the commitment as at BBHF  to meet the health, social, economic, educational, communal, and spiritual needs of all people especially Africa. 
     We are committed to through effective partnerships with individuals and corporate organisations meet these goals , excel in this grace of giving and with strategic efforts efffect sustainable developments in the lives of all people especially Africa and African Communities.
